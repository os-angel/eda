# Exploratory Data Analysis and K-means Clustering for Fraud Detection

## **Description**


The dataset contains credit card transactions made in September 2013 by some cardholders. In total, the dataset contains 293 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807.
The data contains numerical values due to a transformation from a principal component analysis (PCA). Further personal information about the credit card owners is not available, thus ensuring data confidentiality.
We are going to apply an unsupervised ML algorithm (**K-Means**) to be able to group and predict fraudulent transactions based on input features.
